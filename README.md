# Zack's Spec Project

## Idea

Create a web application to allow users to create, updated, delete, and edit database information for tracking patent relationships. 

### Complexity

Web app will contain simple views, complexity in data normalization and sql joins.

## MVP

Landing page view.\
Login/register view.\
Multi-Page database query view.\
- sub view add form
- sub view edit form

404 view.

Users can log in with different permissions for different accesibility in the app.
Viewer permissions can search and view the database information.
Editor permissions can update existing information. 
Admin permissions can add and delete information.

### Future Features

Create an infographic/org-chart of an inventors related patents/disclosures.
Auto-generated quarterly report.
Raw sql query view (like pgweb)
